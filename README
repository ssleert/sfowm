sfowm - fork of dwm
============================
sfowm is fast and small dynamic window manager for X
with compositor, gaps and rounded corners

Requirements
------------
In order to build sfowm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (sfowm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install sfowm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running sfowm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start sfowm using startx:

    exec sfowm

In order to connect sfowm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec sfowm

(This will start sfowm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec sfowm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of sfowm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
